# buidler-evm-ethers-v4

This project is a reproduction of a connection refused but when using
Buidler EVM with Jest and ethers v4 as described [here](https://github.com/nomiclabs/buidler/issues/681).

This project was bootstrapped with [TSDX](https://github.com/formik/tsdx).

## Local Development

### `npm test`

Runs the test watcher (Jest) in an interactive mode.
By default, runs tests related to files changed since the last commit.

This will produce the `Error: invalid response - 0` error.
